mainHeader: Introduction
description: |-
  Komodo's blockchain technology enables developers to create and run fully independent blockchains 
  in a secure and highly competitive environment.
bulletStart: |-
  Each independent blockchain built on the Komodo framework has a wide range of capabilities, including:
bullets:
  - bullet: Bitcoin-hash rate supported security
  - bullet: Zero-knowledge privacy
  - bullet: Enterprise-level scalability
  - bullet: Consensus customization
  - bullet: Blockchain clustering
  - bullet: ...and more!
closing: |-
  Because a Komodo-based blockchain is independently managed, the developer has complete freedom,
   so long as the essential connections to the Komodo ecosystem remain.
