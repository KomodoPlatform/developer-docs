description: |-
  Komodo's blockchain technology enables developers to create and run fully independent blockchains 
  in a secure and highly competitive environment.

  Each independent blockchain built on the Komodo framework has a wide range of capabilities, including:
bullets: |
  ■ Bitcoin-hash rate supported security              ■ Zero-knowledge privacy
  ■ Enterprise-level scalability                                  ■ Consensus customization
  ■ Blockchain clustering                                          ■ ...and more!
closing: |-
  Because a Komodo-based blockchain is independently managed, the developer has complete freedom,
   so long as the essential connections to the Komodo ecosystem remain.
