# Simple Installations

## Smart Chain Installation

To install the Komodo daemon, `komodod`, and its necessary counterpart, `komodo-cli`, the simplest method is to download pre-compiled binaries.

Downloadable packages are available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

#### Link to Download Software

[Download and unzip the software files for your operating system..](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases)

#### Installing the Simple Downloadable Files

Once unzipped, the executables do not require installation. Simply find `komodod` and `komodo-cli` in the directory where you unzipped the files.

You may also build `komodod` and `komodo-cli` from source. This is not required, but it is considered the best practice. Building from source enables you to receive the latest patches and security upgrades the moment they are pushed to the `komodod` source.

#### Using the official Docker image

Komodo offers a Docker image that has pre-built versions of the Komodo software. The image is based on the Ubuntu operating system and offers different versions of the software that are built from different Komodo Github repositories, such as the `dev`, `beta`, and `research` branches.

The Docker image can be found here: [https://hub.docker.com/r/komodoofficial/komodo](https://hub.docker.com/r/komodoofficial/komodo).

An example of how the image can be used is available in this [github repository](https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo_docker_tests).

#### See the Smart Chains Documentation for Further Details
