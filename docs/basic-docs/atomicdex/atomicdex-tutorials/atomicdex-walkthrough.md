# Komodo DeFi Framework Walkthrough

Now that you have the Komodo DeFi Framework [installed](../atomicdex-setup/get-started-atomicdex.md) you are ready for your first atomic swap!

Since we're testing Komodo DeFi Framework as a back end, we're going to be doing a few things that a normal user using a GUI will not be expected to do.

Let's open up the terminal and get started.

## Setting Up the Coin List

In the Komodo ecosystem we use two blockchain coins, RICK and MORTY, for testing purposes. These coins are freely distributed and have no blockchain scarcity, so you don't want to treat these coins as real currency. Also, if you lose them or destroy them, there's no need to stress. You can always grab more from our faucet.

Let's set up a file in the `~/atomicDEX-API/target/debug` directory to import the settings for these test coins. Make a file called `coins` and place the following text into it:

```json
[
  {
    "coin": "RICK",
    "asset": "RICK",
    "fname": "RICK (TESTCOIN)",
    "rpcport": 25435,
    "txversion": 4,
    "overwintered": 1,
    "mm2": 1,
    "protocol": {
      "type": "UTXO"
    }
  },
  {
    "coin": "MORTY",
    "asset": "MORTY",
    "fname": "MORTY (TESTCOIN)",
    "rpcport": 16348,
    "txversion": 4,
    "overwintered": 1,
    "mm2": 1,
    "protocol": {
      "type": "UTXO"
    }
  }
]
```

Save this file. Komodo DeFi Framework will search for it automatically on launch.

::: tip
The `coins` file in [this linked repository](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins) contains the standard coin configuration file used in GUI software.

The `electrum server configuration` for enabling coins can also be found in the the [electrums directory](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/tree/master/electrums) in the KomodoPlatform-coins repository.
:::

#### RPC password

We also need to choose a password.

Make it a secure one by including at least 8 characters, both uppercase and lowercase letters, and a few numbers and symbols.

Write this down in a safe location where you won't lose it.

We have our initial materials, let's launch the software.

## Initiate Komodo DeFi Framework 2.0

Look at the following command below, but don't execute it yet:

```bash
stdbuf -oL ./mm2 "{\"gui\":\"Docs_Walkthru\",\"netid\":7777, \"userhome\":\"/${HOME#"/"}\", \"passphrase\":\"YOUR_PASSPHRASE_HERE\", \"rpc_password\":\"YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE\"}" &
```

Replace `YOUR_PASSPHRASE_HERE` and `YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE` with your actual passphrase and password, and then execute the command in the terminal.

Here is an approximate interpretation of the arguments in the command, to help you see what's happening:

| Argument     | (Value)              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| gui          | Docs_Walkthru        | information about your GUI; place essential info about your application (name, version, etc.) here. For example: Komodo Mobile Wallet iOS 1.0.1                                            |
| netid        | 7777                 | this tells the Komodo DeFi Framework which network to join. 7777 is the default network, though you can set this to a different value to use a separate network if seednodes exist for it. |
| passphrase   | YOUR_PASSPHRASE_HERE | your passphrase; this is the source of each of your coins' private keys                                                                                                                    |
| rpc_password | YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE   | your password for protected RPC methods (userpass)                                                                                                                                         |
| userhome     | /\${HOME#"/"}        | the path to your home, called from your environment variables and entered as a regular expression                                                                                          |

Having executed the command, you should see output similar to the following:

```bash
29 19:39:41, lp_coins:796] ticker = "BTC", method = Some("enable"), block_count = 0 ðŸ˜… 2019-01-29 20:39:41 +0100 [coin KMD no-conf] Warning, coin KMD is used without a corresponding configuration.

The terminal will then repeat similar output to the following every so often:

```bash

04 21:28:47, peers:355] Sending a ping to V4(54.36.126.42:7803)â€¦

```

If you see something similar, the Komodo DeFi Framework is up and running!

::: tip

When using the Komodo DeFi Framework on a VPS without accompanying tools such as `tmux` or `screen`, Komodo recommends that the user add the command `nohup` to the Komodo DeFi Framework launch command. This addition ensures that the Komodo DeFi Framework instance is not shutdown when the user logs out.

Example:

```bash
stdbuf -oL nohup ./mm2 "{\"gui\":\"Docs_Walkthru\",\"netid\":7777, \"userhome\":\"/${HOME#"/"}\", \"passphrase\":\"YOUR_PASSPHRASE_HERE\", \"rpc_password\":\"YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE\"}" &
```

:::

## Setting userpass Environment Variable

::: tip
Userpass will be renamed to <b>rpc_password</b> for clarity in the near future
:::

Make a new file in the `~/atomicDEX-API/target/debug` directory called `userpass` and enter the following text, including the `rpc_password` you specified earlier:

```bash
export userpass="RPC_PASSWORD"
```

Save it, and then in the terminal execute:

```bash
source userpass
```

Test it by executing:

```bash
echo $userpass
```

You should see your userpass as a returned value.

::: tip
The `userpass` environment variable will remain in our terminal's memory until we close the session. When we open up a new session later, we need to create the `userpass` environment variable again. Later, a GUI designer can create functionality to perform this automatically.  
:::

## Connect to the Relevant Coin Networks

While we did set up the coins' configuration properties in the internal files, MM2 isn't going to connect to their blockchain networks immediately.

One reason for this is that if you trade between many coins, the startup process would require connecting to every coin all at once.

We'll tell MM2 that we're ready to activate these coins now.

Execute the following command:

```bash
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"electrum\",\"coin\":\"RICK\",\"servers\":[{\"url\":\"electrum1.cipig.net:10017\"},{\"url\":\"electrum2.cipig.net:10017\"},{\"url\":\"electrum3.cipig.net:10017\"}]}"
```

You should get a similar response:

```json
{
  "address": "RLgAgBFHFbG2ma9MDTHyKL5vovftMepBkE",
  "coin": "RICK",
  "balance": 16.95595733,
  "result": "success"
}
```

You are now connected to the RICK test-blockchain network.

Let's connect to MORTY (note it uses a different Electrum port).

```bash
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"electrum\",\"coin\":\"MORTY\",\"servers\":[{\"url\":\"electrum1.cipig.net:10018\"},{\"url\":\"electrum2.cipig.net:10018\"},{\"url\":\"electrum3.cipig.net:10018\"}]}"
```

You should get a similar response:

```json
{
  "address": "RLgAgBFHFbG2ma9MDTHyKL5vovftMepBkE",
  "coin": "MORTY",
  "balance": 11.27710708,
  "result": "success"
}
```

You are now connected to the MORTY test-blockchain network.

## Get MORTY From a Faucet

Note that in the examples the address, `RLgAgBFHFbG2ma9MDTHyKL5vovftMepBkE`, is present in both returned responses.

You will see a different address in your returned responses.

This address is unique to you and you will use it for our trades here.

We don't recommend placing anything valuable in this address for now, as Komodo DeFi Framework is still in testing.

On the other hand, RICK and MORTY have no real value, so you can place as much in here as you like!

Let's retrieve some MORTY.

[Click on this link](https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/faucet/morty) and you should see an address input box.

Place your address in there, fill out the reCaptcha to prove you're a human, and hit `OK`.

In a minute or so a few MORTY coins will arrive in your address.

You can check by executing this command:

```bash
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"my_balance\",\"coin\":\"MORTY\"}"
```

You should see a similar response:

```json
{
  "address": "RQNUR7qLgPUgZxYbvU9x5Kw93f6LU898CQ",
  "balance": 77.7,
  "coin": "MORTY"
}
```

You now have MORTY.

## Observing the Orderbook

The Komodo DeFi Framework uses a decentralized orderbook to allow users to buy and sell from each other without having to rely on a centralized service. This gives it an increased level of security, as there is no central agency that can manipulate prices. This also prevents "wash" trading, where trading activity is faked.

To see the orderbook's current state, execute the following command:

```bash
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"orderbook\",\"base\":\"RICK\",\"rel\":\"MORTY\"}"
```

This sends a request to MM2 to see who is willing to give up RICK for MORTY.

The call will return a similar result:

```json
{
  "bids": [],
  "numbids": 0,
  "biddepth": 0,
  "asks": [
    {
      "coin": "RICK",
      "address": "RJTYiYeJ8eVvJ53n2YbrVmxWNNMVZjDGLh",
      "price": "0.89999998",
      "price_rat": [
        [1, [813957463, 471859]],
        [1, [0, 524288]]
      ],
      "price_fraction": {
        "numer": "2026619787280727",
        "denom": "2251799813685248"
      },
      "maxvolume": "10855.85028615",
      "max_volume_rat": [
        [1, [3593286463, 1389548]],
        [1, [0, 128]]
      ],
      "max_volume_fraction": {
        "numer": "5968066809508671",
        "denom": "549755813888"
      },
      "pubkey": "5a2f1c468b7083c4f7649bf68a50612ffe7c38b1d62e1ece3829ca88e7e7fd12",
      "age": 5,
      "zcredits": 0,
      "uuid": "5bff6021-b086-477e-b874-f45d898933fe",
      "is_mine": false
    }
  ],
  "numasks": 1,
  "askdepth": 0,
  "base": "RICK",
  "rel": "MORTY",
  "timestamp": 1549319941,
  "netid": 7777
}
```

This is the current orderbook.

Notice that the output is not easily readable in the terminal. This is where we start using `jq`.

You may remember that we installed software called `jq` during the setup process. `jq` is optional, but it is recommended as it makes reading the output in the terminal easier.

To activate `jq`, simply add the following to the end of any command: `| jq`.

For example:

```bash
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"orderbook\",\"base\":\"RICK\",\"rel\":\"MORTY\"}" | jq
```

(If using `jq` gives you troubles, you can remove it from any of the commands without issue. It is only here for convenience.)

Here's the response:

```
{
  "bids": [],
  "numbids": 0,
  "biddepth": 0,
  "asks": [
    {
      "coin": "RICK",
      "address": "RJTYiYeJ8eVvJ53n2YbrVmxWNNMVZjDGLh",
      "price": "2",
      "price_rat": [
        [1, [2]],
        [1, [1]]
      ],
      "price_fraction": {
        "numer": "2",
        "denom": "1"
      },
      "maxvolume": "10855.85028615",
      "max_volume_rat": [
        [1, [3593286463, 1389548]],
        [1, [0, 128]]
      ],
      "max_volume_fraction": {
        "numer": "5968066809508671",
        "denom": "549755813888"
      },
      "pubkey": "5a2f1c468b7083c4f7649bf68a50612ffe7c38b1d62e1ece3829ca88e7e7fd12",
      "age": 9,
      "zcredits": 0,
      "uuid": "5bff6021-b086-477e-b874-f45d898933fe",
      "is_mine": false
    }
  ],
  "numasks": 1,
  "askdepth": 0,
  "base": "RICK",
  "rel": "MORTY",
  "timestamp": 1549320152,
  "netid": 7777
}
```

That's much easier to read. We can easily see someone with the address `RJTYiYeJ8eVvJ53n2YbrVmxWNNMVZjDGLh`.

```
"address": "RJTYiYeJ8eVvJ53n2YbrVmxWNNMVZjDGLh",
```

They are willing to give up RICK for MORTY.

```
"base": "RICK",
"rel": "MORTY",
```

They are asking `2` MORTY for every `1` RICK.

```
"price": 2,
```

They have a total of `10855.85028615` available to trade.

```
"maxvolume": 10855.85028615,
```

## Initiate a Swap

Let's create a RICK/MORTY `buy` order

```bash
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"buy\",\"base\":\"RICK\",\"rel\":\"MORTY\",\"volume\":\"1\",\"price\":\"2\"}" | jq
```

You should receive a similar response:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "action": "Buy",
    "base": "RICK",
    "base_amount": "1",
    "dest_pub_key": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "method": "request",
    "rel": "MORTY",
    "rel_amount": "2",
    "sender_pubkey": "c213230771ebff769c58ade63e8debac1b75062ead66796c8d793594005f3920",
    "uuid": "288743e2-92a5-471e-92d5-bb828a2303c3"
  }
}
```

If you see order data in the response, the order was successfully submitted to the network.

Your swap is not yet started, however.

From here, everything is automated.

If your order is matched you will see something similar in terminal output:

```bash

```bash

```

Let's check by looking at your RICK balance. Execute this command:

```bash
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"my_balance\",\"coin\":\"RICK\"}" | jq
```

You should receive a similar response, the balance will be a bit less than volume set on trade as you have to pay the fee to mine your swap transaction:

```
{
  "address": "RQNUR7qLgPUgZxYbvU9x5Kw93f6LU898CQ",
  "balance": 0.99999,
  "coin": "RICK"
}
```

Congratulations! You are one of the first people in history to trade a currency without any help from a middleman and without even having to know your trading partner.

When you are finished, exit using the following command:

```bash
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"stop\"}"
```
