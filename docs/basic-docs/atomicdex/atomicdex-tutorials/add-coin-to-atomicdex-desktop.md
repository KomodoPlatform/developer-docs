# Adding a Coin on Komodo Desktop Wallet

Before a coin can be listed in Komodo Desktop Wallet, it needs to be confirmed for compatibility, and present within the [Komodo Platform coins repository](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins).

This involves:

- Setting up two operational [electrum servers](https://electrumx-spesmilo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Setting up a [block explorer](https://github.com/gcharang/komodo-install-explorer)
- Performing a [test swap](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/tree/master/swaps)
- Submitting a Pull Request (PR) to the [coins repository](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins)

Once these steps are complete, you can submit a PR to the [Komodo Desktop Wallet repository](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop)

Here is an [actual example](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/pull/1504) of the files that need to be modified:

1. Add information to [0.x.x-coins.json](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/blob/dev/assets/config/0.5.4-coins.json). Note: This filename changes depending on the current version of the Desktop app.
2. Add [TradingView IDs](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/blob/dev/atomic_defi_design/Dex/Constants/General.qml#L487) (optional) if available. This is used to show price graphs.
3. Add an entry to the [Style.qml file](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/blob/dev/atomic_defi_design/Dex/Constants/Style.qml#L278), to define the text color used to display the coin name. Be sure to check that this color works well and is readable within both lite and dark themes.
4. Add a coin icon to the [atomic_defi_design/assets/images/](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/tree/dev/atomic_defi_design/assets/images/coins) folder. This should be in PNG format, optimised for filesize (less than 500kb), and at least 128 x 128 pixels in size.
5. Add a reference to the icon image file into [qml.qrc](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/blob/dev/atomic_defi_design/qml.qrc#L162)

## Add TradingView IDs (optional)

Simply search for the coin on [https://www.tradingview.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/](https://www.tradingview.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/), and click on a result to see it's graph.

The URL of the graph will be something like [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AKMDBTC](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3AKMDBTC). Substitute `%3A` for `:` and we end up with `BINANCE:KMDBTC`, which represents the exchange and pair displayed on the graph.

For each graph available for the coin on Trading View, you can PR to add its ID to [Constants/General.qml](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/blob/dev/atomic_defi_design/Dex/Constants/General.qml#L487)

The format looks like `"KMD/BTC": "BINANCE:KMDBTC"`. Only one graph ID per pair is required.

## Update Style.qml

This is the easy bit! Just add a key/value entry with the coins ticker as key and a [hex color](https://www.color-hex.com/) as the value. Make sure the color you choose has good contrast against the lite and dark theme backgrounds.

By default, Network tokens will use the [same color](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/blob/dev/atomic_defi_design/Dex/Constants/Style.qml#L241) as their parent chain. For example, a QRC-20 token will use the same hex color as QTUM.

## Upload a Coin Icon

Generally the best quality icon image would be sourced directly from the project developing the coin. Alternatively, it could be sourced from a 3rd party such as [http://cryptoicons.co/](http://cryptoicons.co/), a block explorer, [CoinPaprika](https://coinpaprika.com), [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com), or [Nomics](https://nomics.com)

If you have [created a new smart chain](../../smart-chains/smart-chain-tutorials/create-a-default-smart-chain.html) and need a designer to help with creating an icon, there is much talent within the [Komodian community](https://discord.gg/53dxfFWj3x)

## Update qml.qrc

This file defines resources such as images to be used in the Desktop app. To make sure the app is aware of the icon you;ve uploaded, all you need to do is add an entry into this file with the path to your icon (relative to the qml.qrc file).

For example, `<file>assets/images/coins/minds.png</file>`

## Submit the Pull Request

If you are new to Github, you'll need to make an account first, and might want to read their [Pull Request Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

Next, fork the [Komodo Desktop Walletrepository](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/), and once you have made the required updates in your fork, make the [pull request](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/compare)

The Komodo Platform Team will review your updates, and if anything needs fixing they will leave a comment detailing any changes that are needed before it is approved. Once approved, your updates will be merged into the `dev` branch, and upon release of the next version of [Komodo Desktop Wallet](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop), your coin will be available in the app.
