# Komodo DeFi Framework configuration

Komodo DeFi Framework configuration parameters are [listed in the source code](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2.1/mm2src/mm2.rs#L126), along with [additional runtime flags](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2.1/mm2src/mm2.rs#L115), and [per-process environment variables](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2.1/mm2src/mm2.rs#L171)

## MM2.json

When running the Komodo DeFi Framework via commandline with the `mm2` binary, some basic configuration parameters need to be defined in either an `MM2.json` file, or at runtime.

| Parameter           | Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| dbdir               | string          | Komodo DeFi Framework database path. Optional, defaults to a subfolder named `DB` in the path of your `mm2` binary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| rpcip               | string          | IP address to bind to for RPC server. Optional, defaults to 127.0.0.1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| rpc_local_only      | boolean         | If `false` the Komodo DeFi Framework will allow rpc methods sent from external IP addresses. Optional, defaults to `true`. **Warning:** Only use this if you know what you are doing, and have put the appropriate security measures in place.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| i_am_seed           | boolean         | Runs Komodo DeFi Framework as a seed node mode (acting as a relay for Komodo DeFi Framework clients). Optional, defaults to `false`. Use of this mode is not reccomended on the main network (7777) as it could result in a pubkey ban if non-compliant. on alternative testing or private networks, at least one seed node is required to relay information to other Komodo DeFi Framework clients using the same netID. |
| seednodes           | list of strings | Optional. If operating on a test or private netID, the IP address of at least one seed node is required (on the main network, these are already hardcoded)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| hd_account_id       | integer         | Optional. If this value is set, the Komodo DeFi Framework will work in only the HD derivation mode, coins will need to have a coin derivation path entry in the `coins` file for activation. The `hd_account_id` value effectively takes its place in the full derivation as follows: `m/44'/COIN_ID'/<hd_account_id>'/CHAIN/ADDRESS_ID`                                                                                  |

Example (allowing weak password):

```json
{
  "gui": "DEVDOCS_CLI",
  "netid": 7777,
  "rpc_password": "ENTER_UNIQUE_PASSWORD",
  "passphrase": "ENTER_UNIQUE_SEED_PHRASE_DONT_USE_THIS_CHANGE_IT_OR_FUNDS_NOT_SAFU",
  "allow_weak_password": true,
  "userhome": "/${HOME#\"/\"}",
  "dbdir": "/path/to/DB/folder"
}
```

Example (not allowing weak password):

```json
{
  "gui": "DEVDOCS_CLI",
  "netid": 7777,
  "rpc_password": "Ent3r_Un1Qu3_Pa$$w0rd",
  "passphrase": "ENTER_UNIQUE_SEED_PHRASE_DONT_USE_THIS_CHANGE_IT_OR_FUNDS_NOT_SAFU",
  "allow_weak_password": false,
  "userhome": "/${HOME#\"/\"}",
  "dbdir": "/path/to/DB/folder"
}
```

The `mm2` binary will look for the `MM2.json` in the same folder as your `mm2` binary, unless it is defined as being in a different path via the `MM2_CONF_PATH` environment variable.
Alternatively, you can define the `MM2.json` parameters at runtime as below:

```bash
stdbuf -oL nohup ./mm2 "{\"gui\":\"DEVDOCS_CLI\",\"netid\":7777, \"userhome\":\"/${HOME#"/"}\", \"passphrase\":\"ENTER_UNIQUE_SEED_PHRASE_DONT_USE_THIS_CHANGE_IT_FUNDS_OR_NOT_SAFU\", \"rpc_password\":\"Ent3r_Un1Qu3_Pa$$w0rd\"}" &
```

::: tip

When using the Komodo DeFi Framework on a VPS without accompanying tools such as `tmux` or `screen`, it is recommended that the user add the command `nohup` to the Komodo DeFi Framework launch command. This addition ensures that the Komodo DeFi Framework instance is not shutdown when the user logs out.

Optional environment variables that can be user defined are as follows:

| Variable      | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MM2_CONF_PATH | string | File path. MM2 will try to load the JSON configuration from this file. The file must contain valid json with structure mentioned above. Defaults to `MM2.json` in the same folder as your `mm2` binary                                                    |
| MM_COINS_PATH | string | File path. MM2 will try to load coins data from this file. File must contain valid json. A comprehensive version for public use is maintained in the [Komodo Platform coins github repository](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/coins) |
| MM_LOG        | string | File path. Must end with '.log'. The Komodo DeFi Framework will write logs to this file.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| USERPASS      | string | For convenience, this variable can store the value of your `rpc_password` to be referenced in any shell scripts                                                                                                                                           |

## Setting userpass Environment Variable

::: tip
Userpass will be renamed to <b>rpc_password</b> for clarity in the near future
:::

Make a new file in the `~/atomicDEX-API/target/debug` directory called `USERPASS` and enter the following text, including the `rpc_password` you specified earlier:

```bash
export USERPASS="RPC_PASSWORD"
```

Save it, and then in the terminal execute:

```bash
source USERPASS
```

Test it by executing:

```bash
echo $USERPASS
```

You should see your USERPASS as a returned value.

::: tip
The `USERPASS` environment variable will remain in our terminal's memory until we close the session. When we open up a new session later, we need to create the `USERPASS` environment variable again.
:::

Refer to the rest of the Komodo DeFi Framework documentation for details and examples of how to:

- [Enable coins](../../atomicdex-api-legacy/coin_activation.html)
- [Place orders](../../atomicdex-api-legacy/buy.html)
- [View the orderbook](../../atomicdex-api-legacy/orderbook.html)
- [Check your balance](../../atomicdex-api-legacy/my_balance.html)
- [Configure bot trading!](../../atomicdex-api-20/start_simple_market_maker_bot.html)

When you are finished, you can exit the Komodo DeFi Framework using the following command:

```bash
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"stop\"}"
```
