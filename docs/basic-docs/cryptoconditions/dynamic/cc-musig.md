::: warning

This module is still in development. The documentation is here for testing purposes.
It is incomplete and may contain some errors.

## Introduction

::: tip

- RPC are in the comments of the file:
  - [komodo/src/cc/musig.cpp](https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/cc/musig.cpp)
- There are comments in the following files that describe musig:
  - [komodo/src/secp256k1/include/secp256k1_musig.h](https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/secp256k1/include/secp256k1_musig.h)
  - [komodo//src/secp256k1/src/modules/musig/example.c](https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/secp256k1/src/modules/musig/example.c)

:::

The module `MuSig` implements a Schnorr-based multi-signature scheme, that produces "Short, constant-size signatures which look the same to verifiers regardless of signer set" and has "Provable security in the plain public key model.". See this [article](https://blockstream.com/2019/02/18/musig-a-new-multisignature-standard/) for more information.

## Build instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo
cd komodo
git checkout jl777
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
```

then

```bash
cd src/cc
./makecclib
cd ../..
make -j$(nproc)
```

### Update

```bash
cd komodo
git checkout jl777
git pull
cd src/cc
./makecclib
cd ../..
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Chain params

In the directory `komodo/src/`

```bash
./komodod -ac_name=MUSIG -ac_supply=100000 -ac_reward=10000000 -pubkey=<yourpub> -ac_cclib=sudoku -ac_cc=2 -addnode=5.9.102.210 &
```

### Get funds to test

In the directory `komodo/src/`

::: tip
Import the private key corresponding to the pubkey used to start the daemon using the [importprivkey](../komodo-api/wallet.html#importprivkey) RPC.
:::

```bash
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MUSIG faucetget
# copy the hex in the response
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MUSIG sendrawtransaction <hex copied from the above response>
```

## Work flow when using MuSig

- first make a combined pubkey using the method [combine.](../dynamic/cc-musig.html#combine) From the response, take note of `combined_pk` and `pkhash`
- next, send some coins to the `combined_pk` using the method [send.](../dynamic/cc-musig.html#send) From the decoded rawtransaction, take note of the `change_script` and `sendtxid`<!-- expalin what these two are -->
- now calculate the message that needs to be signed by all the parties using the method [calcmsg,](../dynamic/cc-musig.html#calcmsg) which uses `change_script` and `sendtxid` as inputs. From the response, take note of `msg`. To create a valid spend, this `msg` needs to be signed by all the participating pubkeys.
- on each signing node, a session needs to be creted using the method [session,](../dynamic/cc-musig.html#session) which takes the follwing arguments as inputs: `ind` (index; node with the first pubkey gets `0`),`numsigners` (number of pubkeys participating), `combined_pk`, `pkhash`, `msg` (message to be signed). From the response on each node, take note of the `commitment` and send all the `commitment`s to all the other nodes.

::: warning

- The `session` method stores the commitment for each node into the global struct.
- Keep in mind there is a single global struct with the `session` unique to each `cclib session` call.
- This means that restarting any deamon in the middle of the process on any of the nodes results in a failure.
- Also `cclib session` method can't called more than a single time on each node during the whole process.
- This is an artificial restriction just to simplify the initial implementation of MuSig

:::

- on each node, use the method [commit,](../dynamic/cc-musig.html#commit)
  which takes the arguments: `pkhash` and `commitment`s from all the other nodes to output `nonce`s. Make sure to exchange the `nonce`s from all the nodes so that each node will have `nonce`s from all the other nodes.
- on each node, use the method [nonce,](../dynamic/cc-musig.html#nonce)
  which takes the arguments: `pkhash` and `nonce`s from all the other nodes to output `partialsig`s. Make sure to exchange the `partialsig`s from all the nodes so that each node will have `partialsig`s from all the other nodes.
- finally, on each node, use the method [partialsig,](../dynamic/cc-musig.html#partialsig)
  which takes the arguments: `pkhash` and `partialsig`s from all the other nodes to output `combinedsig`s. Make sure to exchange the `combinedsig`s from all the nodes so that each node will have `combinedsig`s from all the other nodes. You can verify that all the nodes produced the same `combinedsig`.
- now, for a sanity test, the method [verify](../dynamic/cc-musig.html#verify) can be used to make sure that, this `combinedsig` will work with the `msg` needed for the spend. It takes the arguments `msg`,`combined_pk`, `combinedsig`. <!-- what does it output -->
- now the [spend](../dynamic/cc-musig.html#spend) part. This method takes `sendtxid`,`change_script`,`combinedsig` as inputs. <!-- who can spend, how much,something is missing here -->
