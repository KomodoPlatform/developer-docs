# Introduction to Smart Chain Tutorials

Welcome to the Komodo Smart Chain tutorial documentation.

This section contains tutorials that are specifically designed only for the essential aspects of Smart Chain software. These tutorials often focus on technology that is available to Komodo via upstream technologies, such as Bitcoin or Zcash.

For tutorials regarding other Komodo software, such as <b>Antara</b>, which focuses on Komodo enhancement technologies, or <b>AtomicDEX</b>, which offers cross-chain atomic-swap compatibility, please see their respective documentation centers.

For a targeted learning approach to Komodo's Smart Chain software, please see the Learning Launchpad.
